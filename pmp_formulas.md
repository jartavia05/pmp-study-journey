# PMP Formulas 

These are all the formulas needed for the PMP exam. 

    Future value (FV) = PV (1 + i)^n
    Present value (PV) = FV/ (1 + i)^n
    Target price = target cost + target fee
    Point of Total Assumption (PTA) = [(Ceiling price â€“ target price) / buyerâ€™s share ratio] + target cost]
    Communication channel = n (n -1) / 2
    Earned value (EV) = % complete x budget at completion (BAC)
    Cost variance (CV) = Earned value (EV) â€“ actual cost (AC)
    Schedule variance = Earned value (EV) â€“ planned value (PV)
    Cost performance index (CPI) = EV / AC
    Schedule performance index (SPI) = Earned value (EV) / Planned value (PV)
    Estimate at Completion (EAC) = BAC / CPI
    EAC = AC + Bottom-up ETC
    EAC = AC + (BAC â€“ EV)
    EAC = AC + [(BAC â€“ EV) / (CPI x SPI)]
    Variance at completion (VAC) = BAC â€“ EAC
    Estimate to complete = EAC â€“ AC
    To complete performance index (TCPI) = (BAC â€“ EV) / (EAC â€“ AC)
    Standard deviation (SD) = Pessimistic â€“ Optimistic / 6
    Pert Formula Beta = (P + 4M + O) / 6
    Expected monetary value (EMV) = Probability * Impact
    Risk Priority Number (RPN) = Detection * Occurrence * Severity
    Cost Plus Percentage of Cost (CPPC) Contract = Cost + % of cost as a fee
    Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contract = Cost + fee of fixed amount
    Cost Plus Award Fee Contract = Cost + award fee
    Cost Plus Incentive Fee Contract = Cost + incentive fee
    Return on Investment (ROI) = (Net profit / cost of investment) * 100
    Payback period = initial investment / periodic cash flow
    Cost-Benefit Ratio (CBR) = Net present value of investment / initial investment cost
